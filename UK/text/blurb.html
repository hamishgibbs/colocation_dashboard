<p>Facebook uses anonymized mobile phone location data to understand the probability of &quot;colocation&quot; between administrative areas over time, a proxy for social contact. The definition of colocation is that two users are within the same ~0.6 by ~0.6 km area within the same five minute period in a week. Use this dashboard to explore the network of colocation probabilities in the UK over time.</p>

<p>Colocation maps are spatial network datasets, provided as part of Facebook Data for Good Disease Prevention Maps, that estimate how often people from different regions are colocated. In particular, these maps estimate, for each pair of regions x and y, the probability of a randomly chosen person from x and from y being colocated in the same place during a randomly chosen minute for a given week. Same place implies within the same level 16 Bing tile, which roughly corresponds to a 0.6 km by 0.6 km square, depending on the latitude.</p>
<p>Estimating colocation is especially useful for epidemiological modeling of human-to-human disease transmission. Such modeling requires an understanding of <em>mixing patterns</em> , i.e. how often people would transmit a disease by coming into contact with other people. Colocation Maps can provide such an understanding, and directly inform <em>metapopulation models</em> of disease spread. In these models, epidemiologists consider various subpopulations representing different geographic regions, and the level of coupling between sub-populations depends on how often people from each region come into contact sufficient to transmit a disease. Epidemiologists often turn to commuting data (e.g., from the U.S. Census) to parametrize these couplings, but Colocation Maps can offer a better parametrization and one that can evolve temporally over, for example, the course of social distincing interventions implemented to limit disease spread.</p>

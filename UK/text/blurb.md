Facebook uses anonymized mobile phone location data to understand the probability of "colocation" between administrative areas over time -- a proxy for social contact. Use this dashboard to explore the network of colocation probabilities in the UK over time. Colocation is defined as two individuals within the same ~0.6 by ~0.6 km area during the same five minute period in a given week.

This dashboard is a work in progress, to record a problem with the dashboard or the underlying data, please [create an issue](https://github.com/hamishgibbs/colocation_dashboard/issues/new).
